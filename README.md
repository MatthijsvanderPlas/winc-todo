# Final Assignment: Todo List
You are going to build a TODO list in Vanilla JavaScript!

You will link the Todo list to a RESTful API that we have already built. So you are not going to store any of the data in the front-end of the application. You will get all the data from the "back-end" where you get your own endpoint.

## Information about the database:

### Read this carefully.

- Clone our REST API repository so that it is on your own computer.
- Follow the installation instructions in the README of the repository.
- Read the documentation in the README of the repository to find out how to use this local API.
- Send a GET request to the URL with Postman and check this
- Write a piece of code to send the same GET request and console.log the result so that you also see the empty array there (think of async/await!).
- To get the first item in your endpoint you can send a POST request to the URL, do this first with Postman and then also from JavaScript. Send as the body a JavaScript object with a description and a "done" key that is set to "false". See this example:
```javascript
const data = {description: "buy oatmeal", done: false};
fetch(baseUrl, {
  method: "POST",
  body: JSON.stringify(data),
  headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
});
```
- Check with GET what is in the endpoint.
- You will find that the endpoint works with hashes that it generates itself from your data every time you make a request. Your data will look like this:
```json
{
  "_id": "skdjfhskdjfhsdfk",
  "description": "buy oat milk",
  "done": false,
  "_createdOn": "2020-10-20et etc"
}
```
- As you can see, you will receive an id of the endpoint for free, which you will need later to refer to that specific task.

## Requirements:

- As a user, I want to see an input field in which I can enter my task.
- As a user, I can press a button with the text "Add Task" so that your completed task is added to the list.
- As a user, when I clicked the add button, I see the task appear in my task list.
- Delete task: As a user, I can click in the task list on an icon of a trash can, to the right of the task, which removes the task from my task list.

note: there are a lot of examples of TODO-list apps with Vanilla JavaScript on the internet ⇒ Copying code one-to-one from a website or from a fellow student is not the intention.

## API requirements:

- GET: Get the (initial) list of tasks from the database.
- POST: Update the task list with 1 new task. Send only {description: "blah", done: false}
- DELETE: Delete a task from the database. Use the id you get back as an identifier.
- Create a file called api-client.js as you have learned lately for all your requests.

## Extra Bonus:

Additional requirements:

- Cross out a task: As a user, I can click on a checkbox in the task list, to the left of the task, which crosses the text of the task.
- As a user, I want to be able to click on my task and change the text.

Additional API requirements (related to the above):

- PUT: update an existing task the property done or not done.
- PUT: update an existing task with the PUT method.

## Design:

Also this week: styling is not important. Don't spend a lot of time styling! Focus on functionalities first and then on styling (we'll be styling next week, no worries).

## Tips

- In this project, you will add event listeners to HTML elements added by Javascript. If you want to link the event listener before the element is added, this fails. This requires a different approach! Make sure you don't assign your event listeners until last, or do this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34896106/attach-event-to-dynamic-elements-in-javascript
- You don't need any scripts, no authentication, and nothing extra to call the API. fetch is your friend!
- fetch can do more than just fetch data; it can also send and update data. Check this documentation on how to do that: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch
- A method like getElementsByClassName returns an HtmlCollection. This looks like an array in your console, but it's not! You can convert this to an array and then loop over it.
